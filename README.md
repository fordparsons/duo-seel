# duo-seel

Duo Sales Engineering Enablement Lab (SEEL) is a project to make a collection of Duo application integrations and functions easily stood up and torn down in a local laptop environment. Each "Inflation" is a Docker containerized application, paired with a local config file and bash script to build and run it locally in Docker for Mac.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions in "start-here.md".

## Inflations
Select a resource from "inflate.md", complete its config file, submit its script, and access the app.
